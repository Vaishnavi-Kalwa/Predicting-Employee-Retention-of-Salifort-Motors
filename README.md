# Predicting-Employee-Retention-of-Salifort-Motors
# Overview
Goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company. This project utilized Salifort Motors data collected by HR Department. The final random forest model performed with 96% accuracy determining what features were most important for employee rentention. Based on the model employees satisfaction level, tenure and overtime work were most influential in determining whether employee would quit or stay.

# Business Understanding
The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they don’t know what to do with it. They refer to you as a data analytics professional and ask you to provide data-driven suggestions based on your understanding of the data. They have the following question: what’s likely to make the employee leave the company?

# Data Understanding
The dataset contains 14999 employees details and 10 features. The features included information on employee satisfaction level, average monthly hours, number of years worked/working, number of projects, department and salary.  

# Modeling and Evaluation
Logistic Regression and Random Forest were used for predictions. As a result Random Forest with 96% f1-score performs well compared to Logistic Regression with 96% accuracy. 

# Conclusion
Employee satisfaction, number of years worked and overtime work are the factors mainly effecting the employee's retention.
So, they have to still conduct a survey on particular satisfaction, like which factors make them leave the company like salary hike, overtime, promotions.
And most of the employees left are the persons who worked between 2-6 years. So, the company has to grant salary hike and additional benefits for those employees who worked for more than 2 years. And promotions for those who worked for more than 4 years.
Overworked employees should get more pay.
